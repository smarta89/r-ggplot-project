## Use this file to follow along with the live coding exercises.
## The csv file containing the data is in the 'data/' directory.
## If you want to save plots you created, place them in the 'figures/' directory.
## You can create additional R files in the 'scripts/' directory.

## only tells ggplot what data, not specifically what to plot

ggplot(data = interviews_plotting,

##gives the axis but not how we want to display it, eg bar or scatter?

ggplot(data = interviews_plotting,

  geom_point()
## scatter plot

ggplot(data = interviews_plotting,

  geom_line()
##line plot

  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
## point transparency is alpha, the darker the points the more points on that spot

  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5)
##instead of each point being exactally on the point it is slightly off point so we can see all the points and where they lie

  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width =0.15, height = 0.15)
## to tell it how much you want it to jitter by. in this case it will move each point up to 0.15 units away from the original place

                          aes (x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +

##to save this line of data as interviews_plot

ggsave ("fig_output/membrs_item.png", interviews_plot, width = 15, height = 10, dpi =72)
## to save the plot with specific dimensions and clarity dpi

## to change colours
## smooth to add line of fit
## if it doesnt plot the change highlight what you want it to do and then press control enter
